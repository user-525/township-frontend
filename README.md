Prerequisites
Node.js (v14 or later)
npm (v6 or later)
MongoDB (local or remote)

Frontend Setup:-
Navigate to the Frontend Directory

Open a new terminal tab in VS Code and navigate to the frontend directory.

bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend
Install Frontend Dependencies

Run the following command to install required packages:

npm install
Update API Endpoint

Configure the API endpoint in your React app to point to your backend server. For that we need to change the url of the current api in the utils.js into the live api in which the backend server is running

Start the Frontend Development Server

In the terminal, start the React app:

npm run dev
The React app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Deployment
For deployment, consider using services such as Heroku for the backend and Netlify or Vercel for the frontend. Update environment variables and configuration settings accordingly.

Troubleshooting
MongoDB Connection Issues: Verify your MongoDB URI and ensure MongoDB is running.
API Endpoint Errors: Check the configuration of your API endpoints in both frontend and backend.
CORS Issues: Ensure proper CORS configuration in your Express.js server.
